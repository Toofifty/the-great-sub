# The Great Sub v2.0

Source code repository for the Reddit subreddit / bot combo that is The Great Sub.

Basically, it listens in to Reddit's new comment stream, gets the newest comment's subreddit, steals it's top post and posts it to [/r/thegreatsub](http://www.reddit.com/r/thegreatsub/). Rinse, wait 5 min, repeat. It's just a little bit of fun and Python, though it's helped me discover plenty of new subreddits.
